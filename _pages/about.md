I received the B.S. degree from [College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing University](http://www.cme.cqu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China, in 2022. And the M.S. degree from [School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University](https://me.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China. Now I am pursuing Ph.D degree with [School of Data Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China. My research interests cover multimodal perception for autonomous vehicle and robotics, Embodied AI and deep learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Galen](http://guiliang.me/) from CUHK-SZ and [Prof. Guodong Yin](https://me.seu.edu.cn/ygd/list.htm) of [CIEM](https://ciem.seu.edu.cn/) Lab from Southeast University, my respected supervisors taught me a lot and provided me with a great deal of help. I was also advised by [Prof. Yi Xie](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/YiXie1), [Prof. Ye He](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/YeHe) and [Prof. Yinong Li](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/YinongLi) during my undergraduate journey in Chongqing University and I also participated in a project advised by [Prof. Zonghui Li](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9428/) and [Prof. Fei Wu](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/FeiWu1/zh_CN/yjfx/341547/content/3609.htm).
