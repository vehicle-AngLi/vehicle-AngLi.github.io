I received the B.S. degree from [College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Chongqing University](http://www.cme.cqu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China, in 2022. And now is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with [School of Mechanical Engineering, Southeast University](https://me.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China. My research interests cover multimodal perception for autonomous vehicle, image fusion strategy, object detection and deep learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guodong Yin](https://me.seu.edu.cn/ygd/list.htm) of CIEM Lab from Southeast University, my respected supervisor taught me a lot and provided me with a great deal of help. I was also advised by Prof. Yi Xie, Prof. Ye He and Prof. Yinong Li during my undergraduate journey in Chongqing University and I also participate in a project advised by Prof. Zonghui Li and Prof. Fei Wu. I am so fortunate to have met such kind and responsible teachers. Thank you for enlightening me in my research journey.
